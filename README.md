## Why ?

We are two software engineers who are trying to understand software design, using existing application architecture pattern.

A common issue on any pattern is "Doing XXXX by the book just doesn't work", which may be true in a setup (and just the opposite in another).

We don't want to stop there, smiling uneasily or praising a new framework that cure all illnesses (a panacea).  

We want to dig around that: "Why did it didn't work here ?" and, conversely, "Why did it worked there ?".

## Our scope

We foresee some ambiguities, so let's mention them.

### TL,DR

Our scope is limited to:
- application architecture
- on [entreprise application](references/glossary/general.md#entreprise_application)
- especially SPA REST API component

### Are you serious ?

We're not professional application software architects and english is not our mother tongue.
We may burn out of energy in a few weeks, but it doesn't matter.

The point here is:
- to gather what we know and what people experience every day;
- to start thinking and practicing - it's an experiment.

### Architecture or design ?

What is [architecture](references/glossary/general.md#architecture) ?
What is [design](http://www.bleading-edge.com/Publications/C++Journal/Cpjour2.htm) ?
Definition is still in progress.

Let's rather focus on:
- Model View Controller (MVC);
- Hexagonal Architecture;
- Clean Architecture;
- Domain Driven Design.

And try not to delve into:  
- Design Patterns
- Test Driven Development (or is it Design ?)
- Object Oriented design
- Testing concerns

### What about human factors ?

Sure, these are very interesting topics, to name a few:
- training ;
- change management ;
- continuous improvement ;
- project management.

They can make a tremendous difference in solving a problem, much more than an architectural patterns.
But this it of out our scope here.

## Asking a question

First, check if the question:
- hasn't been already answered in [closed issues](https://github.com/octo-topi/oiga-doctor/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed): if so, check the answer;
- hasn't been already asked in [open issues](https://github.com/octo-topi/oiga-doctor/issues): if so, please upvote it.

If nobody ever asked this question, open an issue and follow embedded guidelines.
You may refer to the [sample](https://github.com/octo-topi/oiga-doctor/issues/1) question to get an idea of what kind of input we expect.

If we can't figure your problem, we'll use labels and comments to make it clear.

## Getting a response

Each two weeks, we'll pick the mock upvoted question and post a response including:
- an extract from books to set the context;
- solutions, with advantage and drawbacks so you can make your tradeoff;
- code sample in Java/Spring and NodeJS/Hapi.

The response will come as a [pull request](https://github.com/octo-topi/oiga-doctor/pulls): this way you can review our
work and tell us if the question has been answered.

Keep in mind we're just two people doing an experiment, so the answers may come even more slowly that you expect.

## References

When quoting from books and blogs, we'll try to use only classics, as they're available and well known.
We'll refer to them by hyperlinks [here](references/works.md).

We'll try to use unambiguous words, defined [there](references/glossary).

## Why the name ?

The spanish "Oiga, doctor" means "Doctor, listen to me!'.
We choose a medical metaphor as diagnosis in software engineering is not straightforward and proceed from many causes.

[Hippocratic Oath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocratic_Oath) is inspiring, and we'll try to cope with the following points
- I will respect the hard-won scientific gains of those physicians in whose steps I walk, and gladly share such knowledge as is mine with those who are to follow.
- I will prevent disease whenever I can, for prevention is preferable to cure.
